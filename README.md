# Implementation-of-TCP-Tahoe-in-ns-3

â€‹The previous versions of ns-3 contained the implementation of TCP Tahoe, but it was
removed when TCP codebase in ns-3 was significantly refactored to modularize
TcpSocketBase. It turns out that many researchers still use Tahoe to teach the fundamentals
of TCP. So adding Tahoe back in the mainline of ns-3 would be a valuable addition.
